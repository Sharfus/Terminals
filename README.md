# Terminals
Configurations for the different types of terminals I use.

Some terminals like xterm and urxvt have their settings in .Xresources.  I did not separate out the different settings for those.

I do have both xterm and urxvt on my system as well as Termite and Terminator and xfce4-terminal.
